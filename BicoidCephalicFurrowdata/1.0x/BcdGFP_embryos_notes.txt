High-resolution images of 28 embryos acquired by live two-photon microscopy; dorsal view, coronal plane (linear pixel dimension 0.46 micrometer). Embryos express Bcd-GFP fusion protein in a bcdE1 null mutant background (flyline 2XA). For 23 embryos two time points are provided: 16+/-2 min after mitosis 13 (for Bicoid gradient measurement) and 67+/-2 min after mitosis 13 (for cephalic furrow position measurement). Two additional embryos are provided for early time point (09 and 12); three additional embryos are provided for late time point (15, 24 and 28). Embryo 05 is missing from dataset. This dataset reproduces gradients in Figure 1C of main text.
